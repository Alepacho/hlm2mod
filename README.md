# Reverse Engineering macOS (x86_64) version of Hotline Miami 2

The goal of the project is to make a possibility for a modding of GameBaker.

### What you can do with it for now:
- uhh idk, change object IDs?
- and change some shaders??

### Future goals
- Hook all engine functions
- Implement API for Lua scripting
- Make it cross-platform of course

### How do I use it?
1. Install `XCode Command Line Tools` and `SDL2`
2. Put `Hotline Miami2.app` in a project's folder
3. Open Terminal any type `make`
4. If it gives some errors, pls open a new issue
5. In Terminal, type `cd ./HotlineMiami2.app/Contents/MacOS/`
6. And then `./hlm2mod.sh`

That's it! You can now see some useless debug info in Terminal and ImGui.
